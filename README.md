A deep learning-based approach to detect 38 types of plant diseases using RGB leaf images. Compared ANN, CNN, VGG16, and DenseNet121 on a large Kaggle dataset to evaluate performance, accuracy, and generalization.

This research dives into how well different deep learning models (ANN, CNN, VGG16, DenseNet121) can detect plant diseases just from leaf images.
We trained and tested them on a massive Kaggle dataset, and spoiler alert transfer learning models totally crushed it with up to 98% accuracy.
